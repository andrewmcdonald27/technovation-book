Each week, we'll feature a computer scientist working on real-world problems to highlight the wide
variety of careers possible in computer science. Our goal is for you to see yourself doing what they do!

Katie Sydlik-Badgerow
------------------------------------------

This week, we'd like to introduce Katie Sydlik-Badgerow, a software engineer at Target!
She'll be joining our Zoom shortly to discuss

* why she decided to study computer science
* what a day in her life as a software engineer looks like
* what she enjoys about her job, and
* what she wishes she knew about computer science when she was in your shoes

Katie graduated from Michigan State University in 2019 with her B.S. in Computer Science and Engineering,
and led the very first session of Technovation in Fall 2018! She also helped lead Spartan Girls Who Code
during her time on campus, which some of you may have attended.

Following Katie's introduction, she'll open things up for Q&A---be sure to send your questions in the Zoom chat!
What are you curious about in the world of computer science? What are you concerned or confused about?
What do you want to hear more about?

Next, we'll be kicking off today's *code-along*---stay on this page until a mentor lets you know it's time to move on!
