Icebreaker
:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

Let's kick things off by getting to know one another! Broken ice is much better than solid ice; just ask the Titanic! 

Attendance
------------

Before we dive into our icebreaker, however, be sure to fill out today's attendance form.

* Fall 2020 Technovation Attendance Form

Icebreaker: Describe Yourself with 3 Pictures
----------------------------------------------

Now that we've got attendance taken care of, let's break ice. In the shared Google Document below, add your name
and copy-paste in 3 pictures from Google Images which represent you.
The images can be anything, really: if you're a passionate
athlete, you might paste in a picture of your favorite sport; if you love dogs, you may paste in a picture
of your favorite breed of dog; if you love to bake, you could paste in an image of muffins or cupcakes or
cookies or brownies---whatever's your favorite!

Once everyone has a chance to add their images, we'll go around the group and have you introduce yourself
along with your images. After all, the best way to introduce yourself is to *be* yourself!
Be sure to mention

1. Your name
2. Your grade
3. Where you go to school
4. What your 3 images mean to you
5. What you're most excited for in Technovation

After our icebreaker, we'll move on to today's *spotlight*. Mentors will let you know when
it's time to go onto the next page---until then, stay here on the icebreaker page and browse the images
your classmates pasted in the shared Google Document!
