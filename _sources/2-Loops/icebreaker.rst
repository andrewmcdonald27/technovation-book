This week we'll be putting your artistic skills to the test with
Virtual Pictionary!

How to play:

You'll be broken into small groups where your mentor will have a link to your individual groups game
When it's your turn, choose one of 3 words to draw 
Give the drawing your best shot, and everyone will try to guess what you're drawing
If you're not the one drawing, have fun guessing what someone else is drawing

Make sure you're quick! The faster you are the more points you earn!

**Stay on this Runestone page until told to proceed.**
