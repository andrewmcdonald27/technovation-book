Variables and assignment
-------------------------------------------

A *variable* is a name that you choose to use in your program to stand for a data object. 
You should choose a meaningful name.
For example, you might use ``base_length'' to stand for the number of pixels to make the base of an isosceles triangle and ``height'' to stand for the height (in pixels).

In Python, a variable name needs to start with a letter (uppercase or lowercase) and cannot contain spaces or punctiation 


An *assignment* indicates what data object a variable stands for.




Loops
-----------------------

Do you ever get tired of repeating the same instructions over and over and over and over and over and ... again? Or, weary from the repetition, do you start making mistakes?

Computers don't!
